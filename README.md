# Script that Web Worker uses to hide text from Google Search Bot.

Attention! This is a hack!
Google Search Bot at the time has not yet learned how to read information from the Web Worker.
So, to satisfy the SEO guys, try inserting text into the block attributes by my instruction.
After that, the text will be sent to the Web Worker and after 1 second, it will insert the text inside the block.
Google Search Bot will skip the execution of our script and the text will not be included in the search results!

# Instruction

1. Add the code from the file "hideSeoText.js" to your bundle
2. Put the file "webWorkerForSeoText.js" in assets folder
3. Write down the correct paths in the code from Point 1 to the file from Point 2.
4. Add attributes data-hook="seo-text" and data-inner="HIDDEN_TEXT_HERE"
5. Profit
